        <h1>Welcome To Silver Oak</h1>
        <p>
          Legend tells us that roughly five centuries ago, a glowing figure descended from the heavens and planted a silver acorn, blessing it and the land around it. Over the years, the acorn grew into a magnificent silver Oak tree with dark silver bark that was impenetrable and leaves that twinkled in both sunlight and moonlight.
          <br /><br />
          The tree became the heart of a thriving village, its branches sheltering the people from the worst weather, and its leaves and branches serving the community in various ways. The large root system provided underground passages for food storage and shelter. In return, the village protected the tree, guarding it against those who might misuse its power. Mystic was one of the first settlers in the village, he had a special ability to absorb the power of defeated enemies. He became the guardian of the tree and the village, making sure both were safe.
          <br /><br />
          You grew up hearing these stories, feeling the protection from the tree. That protection gave you a desire to become a protector, so when Mystic came looking for trainees you were eager to sign up. Years have passed and you have honed your abilities and skills under the watchful eye of Mystic.

          One more you enter the training building you notice something is wrong. Mystic was pacing back and forth in the center of the main room. His normal midnight blue skin seemed dull, a grey tint too it. His tail was drooping, dragging on the floor as he paced. The tattoos that normally glow and radiate with power were dark. He stopped the moment he heard you enter the room. He gestured to the meeting table and sat down himself. As you fill the seats you examined his face, he looked older than he did the day before.
          <br /><br />
          “I am glad you are all here, there is a problem.”
          <br /><br />

          <br /><br />
          “There is an evil rot that has affected the tree, and it is affecting me as well. My powers are gone, I need you to go into the root system and find the source and eliminate it.”
